# Ads Astra

A simple static landing page for a satirical space advertising concept.

## Project Structure

The project consists of just two files:

- `ads-astra.html` - The main HTML file containing all structure, content and styles
- `do-it.jpg` - Background image used in the hero section

## Hosting

To host this site, simply upload both files to any static web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Amazon S3, etc.) maintaining their relative paths.

## Local Development

To view the site locally, simply open the `ads-astra.html` file in any web browser.
